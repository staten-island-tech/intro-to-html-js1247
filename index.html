    <p>
      Hi my name is Jason Shi, I am a student attending staten island technical
      high school and is currently taking a computer science class, making this
      about me for that class. I like to eat and cook food. I like to cook food
      that is easy to make and tastes good, such as scrambled eggs and fried
      rice. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends, such as playing
      video games or playing sports. My favorite sports to play are volleyball
      and basketball. I also love to sleep, but on school days I sleep at 10:30
      and wake up at 6:30. On the weekends I sleep at 11 and wake up at 9-10.
      The site I used the most is
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>.
